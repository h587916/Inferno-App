Inferno is a software for doing Bayesian nonparametric density inference. 
The software has been wrapped up into a R package, and is available for anyone with R installed on their computer. 
If you want to use the software directly in R, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/pglpm/inferno">Inferno GitHub repository</a>
and the <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/index.html"> documentation page</a> for further guidence. 
For a practical example of Inferno in action, see the <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/articles/vignette_parkinson.html">Parkinson's Disease vignette</a>,
which demonstrates how to apply Inferno's functions to real-world data from a Parkinson's Disease study. 
If you prefere not to work directly in R, this app is here to save you, making it possible to utilize the power of Inferno with just a few button clicks.
