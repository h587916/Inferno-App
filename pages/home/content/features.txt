Metadata:
    The metadata page is created for managing your datafiles and generating the belonging metadatafile. 
    The main purpose of this feature is to prepare a metadatafile that's needed for running the Monte Carlo Computation in the learn page.
    The metadatafile is basically a CSV-file describing the variables in your dataset, and the structure of this file will have an impact on the end results.
    A metadatafile will be generation based on assumptions, using the <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/reference/metadatatemplate.html">metadatatemplate</a> function from the Inferno R package.
    It's your job to make sure that the generated metadatafile is actually correct, and make any needed adjustments. 
    The metadata page is designed to help you with this process.

Learn:
    The learn page is where you run the Monte Carlo Computation. 
    This is done by using the <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/reference/learn.html">learn </a> function from the Inferno R package. 
    In the app this function is simplified by using a lot of default parameters, but you have the option to configure the most important parameters. 
    All you need for running the somputation is your datafile and the belonging metadatafile. 
    Once the somputation is done, the results are saved in a "learnt" folder.
    This folder will be used when calcutalting probabilities, mutualinfo, etc. 
    It's worth mentioning that the computation could potensially be very time-consuming (depending on your computer hardware, and the size of your datafile).

Plotting:
    The plotting page is where you generate probability plots based on your computation results. 
    You can choose between two probability functions from the Inferno R package, <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/reference/Pr.html">Pr </a> and <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/reference/tailPr.html">tailPr </a>, each offering a different perspective. 
    You can see examples of different plots the two functions can produce <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/articles/vignette_parkinson.html#drawing-inferences">here </a>.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Pr</strong>: Calculates the posterior probabilities: <em>P(Y | X, data)</em>, where Y and X are two (non overlapping) sets of joint variables. 
    The function also gives quantiles about the possible variability of the probability P(Y | X, newdata, data) that we could have if more learning data were provided.
    In the generated plot from this app, the X-axis will show the defined range of a selected numeric Y-variable, and the Y-axis will show the calculated probability values.

    <strong>tailPr</strong>: Calculates the cumulative posterior probabilities: <em>P(Y &le; y | X, data)</em> or <em>P(Y > y | X, data)</em>, where Y and X are two (non overlapping) sets of joint variables. 
    The function also returns quantiles representing the uncertainty in the estimated cumulative probability <em>P(Y â‰¤ y | X, newdata, data)</em>, reflecting how this estimate might vary if additional learning data were provided.
    In the generated plot from this app, the X-axis will show the defined range of a selected numeric X-variable, and the Y-axis will show the calculated cumulative probabilities.
