Metadata:
<blockquote>
    The metadata page is created for managing your datafiles and generating the belonging metadatafile. 
    The main purpose of this feature is to prepare a metadatafile that's needed for running the Monte Carlo Smulation.
    The metadatafile is basically a CSV-file describing the variables in your dataset, and the structure of this file will have an impact on the end results.
    A metadatafile will be generation based on assumptions, using the <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/reference/metadatatemplate.html">metadatatemplate</a> function from the Inferno R package.
    It's your job to make sure that the generated metadatafile is actually correct, and make any needed adjustments. 
    The metadata page is designed to help you with this process.

Learn:
<blockquote>
    The learn page is where you run the Monte Carlo Simulation. 
    This is done by using the <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/reference/learn.html">learn </a> function from the Inferno R package. 
    In the app this function is simplified by using a lot of default parameters, but you have the option to configure the most important parameters. 
    All you need for running the simulation is your datafile and the belonging metadatafile. 
    Once the simulation is done, the results are saved in a "learnt" folder.
    This folder will be used when calcutalting probabilities, mutualinfo, etc. 
    It's worth mentioning that the simulation could potensially be very time-consuming (depending on your computer hardware, and the size of your datafile).

Plotting:
<blockquote> 
    The plotting page is where you generate probability plots based on your simulation results. 
    You can choose between two probability functions from the Inferno R package, <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/reference/Pr.html"><strong>Pr</strong> </a> and <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/reference/tailPr.html"><strong>tailPr</strong> </a>, each offering a different perspective. 
    You can see examples of different plots the 2 functions can produce <a href="https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/articles/vignette_parkinson.html#drawing-inferences">here </a>.<br>
    <br> - <strong>Pr</strong>: Calculates <em>P(Y | X, data)</em>. 
    This function computes the probability of a range of values for a numeric Y-variable against specified values of X-variables. 
    The results include quantiles representing the variability in the probabilities if additional data were available, as well as samples of the probability values. 
    In the plot, the defined range for the numeric Y-variable is displayed on the X-axis, and the probability values are plotted on the Y-axis. 
    <br> - <strong>tailPr</strong>: Calculates <em>P(Y &le; y | X, data)</em> or <em>P(Y > y | X, data)</em>. 
    This function computes cumulative probabilities for a specific value of a numeric Y-variable against specified X-variables. 
    The results include quantiles showing the variability in cumulative probabilities if additional data were available, as well as samples of possible values. 
    The plot displays the numeric X-variable on the X-axis and the cumulative probabilities on the Y-axis. <br>
